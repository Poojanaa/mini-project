decision tree:- The decision tree operates by analyzing the data set to predict its classification. It commences from the treeâ€™s root node, where the algorithm views the value of the root attribute compared to the attribute of the record in the actual data set. Based on the comparison, it proceeds to follow the branch and move to the next node. 

The algorithm repeats this action for every subsequent node by comparing its attribute values with those of the sub-nodes and continuing the process further. It repeats until it reaches the leaf node of the tree. The complete mechanism can be better explained through the algorithm given below.

Step-1: Begin the tree with the root node, says S, which contains the complete dataset.
Step-2: Find the best attribute in the dataset using Attribute Selection Measure (ASM).
Step-3: Divide the S into subsets that contains possible values for the best attributes.
Step-4: Generate the decision tree node, which contains the best attribute.
Step-5: Recursively make new decision trees using the subsets of the dataset created in step -3. Continue this process until a stage is reached where you cannot further classify the nodes and called the final node as a leaf nodeClassification and Regression Tree algorithm.
